# JavaScript: Handling undefined and null values when accessing 'length' property

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: attempting to access the `length` property of a value that is not an array or a string. The provided code showcases how to handle `null` but throws an error when encountering `undefined` or other non-array/string types.

The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (e.g., browser's console, Node.js).
3. Run the code and observe the differences in error handling.
